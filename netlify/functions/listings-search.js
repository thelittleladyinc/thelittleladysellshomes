// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Server-side search over Christine's replicated IRES listing data, backed
// by Netlify Blobs — NOT a live proxy to MLS Grid anymore (see the
// 2026-08-12 note below for why). This keeps the MLS Grid access token
// secret (it never reaches the browser, and this function doesn't even use
// it — only sync-listings.js does) and enforces the IDX compliance rules
// that must be applied no matter what a client sends in the query string:
//   - Only IRES-sourced listings are ever returned, and only in an
//     on-market status (Active only for the general public search; Active +
//     Active Under Contract + Pending for Christine's own mine=true listing
//     showcase) — no sold/closed data, no other MLS's listings. This is
//     enforced twice over: sync-listings.js never even replicates
//     sold/closed data in the first place, and matchesQuery() re-checks
//     status here too.
//   - Only public-safe fields are requested (see SELECT_FIELDS in
//     _mls-shared.js) — nothing from MLS Grid's IDX Rules 21/31 prohibited
//     list (showing instructions, security info, seller/occupant contact).
//
// Full compliance rules this page (and the disclaimer block rendered with
// it in search-homes.html) is built against:
//   https://www.mlsgrid.com/s/MLS-Grid-IDX-Rules.pdf
//
// *** 2026-08-12: WHY THIS FUNCTION NO LONGER QUERIES MLS GRID DIRECTLY ***
// The live search was failing in production with every single query,
// confirmed via a real MLS Grid response:
//   {"error":{"code":400,"message":"Invalid filter field 'ListPrice'",
//   "details":[{"message":"Replication requests to the Property resource
//   can only be filtered using the following fields: MlgCanView,
//   ModificationTimestamp, OriginatingSystemName, StandardStatus,
//   ListingId, PropertyType, ListOfficeMlsId"}]}}
// MLS Grid's Property resource simply does not allow filtering by
// ListPrice, City, BedroomsTotal, etc. — the site's entire "live filtered
// search" design was built on a request shape MLS Grid rejects outright.
// Their own Best Practices Guide describes the only pattern that actually
// works: replicate the allowed dataset into your own storage on a
// schedule, then filter your own copy. sync-listings.js is that
// replication job (runs every 15 minutes via netlify.toml's scheduled
// function config); this function just reads what it wrote and filters in
// JS — see matchesQuery() in _mls-shared.js, which mirrors the exact same
// filtering logic (city/price/beds/baths/subdivision/waterfront/mine) the
// old OData $filter builder used to send to MLS Grid.
//
// Setup required (one-time, Netlify dashboard -> Site settings ->
// Environment variables): MLSGRID_API_TOKEN (used only by sync-listings.js
// now, not this function).

// ---- THE CATALOGUE, PARSED ONCE PER CONTAINER ---------------------------
// 2026-08-18 (Christine: "it just runs so slow ... what if we just brought in a
// few counties"). Her instinct was right and the mechanism was worse than she
// thought. Every public search did this, per request:
//
//   store.get(LISTINGS_KEY, { type: "json" })   // download the WHOLE catalogue
//   Object.values(...).filter(...).sort(...)    // then walk all of it
//
// That is 29,011 listings downloaded and JSON-parsed to return twelve cards, on
// every single search, every time. The work scales with the catalogue and has
// nothing to do with what was asked for — which is exactly why it got slower as
// the crawl grew, and why it felt like "bringing in too many".
//
// Netlify keeps a container warm between requests, so the parse can be done once
// and reused. The memo is invalidated by the SYNC's own clock rather than by a
// timer alone: sync-state.json carries lastRunAt, it is a tiny read, and it
// changes exactly when the data changes. The TTL is a backstop for the case
// where the state blob is unreadable.
//
// mine=true traffic never took this path (it reads the small MINE_LISTINGS_KEY
// copy), which is why her own listings always felt fast and the public search
// did not.

// ---- Photo URLs the browser can actually load ----------------------------
// 2026-08-15 (Christine: "still no photos", with a screenshot of a Search
// Homes page where every card's image was broken). A stored MLS Grid media URL
// is signed and expires in ~1-2 hours, so for any listing the sync hasn't
// re-touched recently -- which, at 15,471 stored listings and a 5-per-run
// refresh sweep, is nearly all of them -- the URL in storage is dead on
// arrival. Never send one to a browser again.
//
// Cloudinary URLs are the exception and the preference: those are already
// re-hosted permanently (Christine's own listings, see
// cacheCoverPhotoIfHers() in sync-listings.js) and cost nothing to serve, so
// they go straight through. Everything else is served by listing-photo.js from
// this site's own domain.

// How many photos this listing is believed to have. ONE definition, used by the
// gallery count, the card's "View All N Photos" label AND the decision to emit a
// cover-photo URL — because those disagreeing is what broke the cards.
//
// 2026-08-17 (Christine: "still no photos - they worked awhile back"). She was right
// on both counts, and the cause was a contradiction inside a single commit from
// 2026-08-15. That commit wrote, for the COUNT: "The stored photoCount has to win
// when photos[] is absent." It then guarded the URL on `listing.photo` and
// `listing.photos` only, ignoring photoCount. So for a listing whose stored photo
// URLs had expired and been dropped but whose photoCount survived, the card
// simultaneously believed there were 50 photos and refused to ask for photo 0.
//
// The visible result was a grey box next to the words "View All 50 Photos", and the
// giveaway was in her own DevTools: NO REQUEST for the photo at all. Not a failed
// one — none. Every rate limit, cooldown and placeholder we chased for hours was
// real and was happening to a request the page never made. I dismissed that empty
// Network tab as "DevTools opened after load"; it was the actual evidence.
//
// The guard's intent was sound — don't emit a URL that can only render a
// placeholder — but it tested the wrong thing. listing-photo.js resolves fresh
// signed URLs from MLS Grid by LISTING ID (resolvePhotoUrls) and needs no stored
// URL whatsoever, which her own debug output proved while the card sat grey:

// a measurement: Chrome shows these phases natively in DevTools → Network → click
// the request → Timing, with no tooling to install and nothing to interpret.
//
// The phases are chosen to separate the candidate causes, because "the search is
// slow" has at least four different fixes depending on which of these dominates:
//   state     - reading sync-state.json (tiny; should be single-digit ms)
//   catalogue - fetching and parsing ~29,000 listings, or reusing the memo
//   filter    - matchesQuery + sort over all of them
//   prewarm   - resolving photo URLs at MLS Grid before responding

    // this page's photo URLs in ONE MLS Grid call before responding, so the 12
    // image requests the browser is about to fire are cache hits instead of 12
    // separate API calls racing each other into MLS Grid's rate limit. Awaited
    // deliberately -- doing it after the response isn't reliable in a Netlify
    // function -- but bounded, best-effort, and skipped entirely when the cache
    // is already warm, so search results are never held up for long and a
    // failure here costs a placeholder, not a broken page.
    // 2026-08-18, measured on Christine's own luxury search rather than guessed:
    //
    //   state;dur=366, catalogue;dur=1768, filter;dur=122, prewarm;dur=2482,
    //   total;dur=4738
    //
    // The prewarm was the single largest cost on the page — 2.5 of 4.7 seconds
    // spent holding the entire response back while MLS Grid resolved photo URLs
    // nobody had asked for yet. Filtering all 29,150 listings, which I had assumed
    // was the expensive part, took 122ms.
    //
    // The prewarm still earns its place: without it a page of cold listings fires
    // a dozen separate resolves at an API limited to two requests a second. But it
    // is an OPTIMISATION, and an optimisation must never cost more than it saves.
    // It now runs against a hard deadline: whatever has resolved by then is
    // cached and helps, and the response goes out regardless. Anything unresolved
    // simply resolves later, on demand, in listing-photo.js — which is the exact
    // path that already handles a direct hit or a shared link.
    //
    // Deliberately NOT fire-and-forget: a Netlify container can freeze the moment
    // it returns, so work nobody waits for is work that only sometimes happens.
    // Waiting a bounded amount is honest; waiting indefinitely was not.
    // 2026-08-24: the deadline was 700ms, which quietly disabled the prewarm.
    // paceMlsCall (added 08-18, AFTER the 700ms was chosen) starts every MLS
    // call with a random 0-1800ms de-synchronization delay -- so the prewarm
    // lost the race to its own pacer's jitter more often than not, before
    // making any request at all. Worse, timeoutMs was set to the same 700ms and
    // used as the fetch abort, so a prewarm that DID start usually aborted
    // mid-request: a spent MLS Grid request that cached nothing. The account's
    // usage log showed the result -- only ~20 of 1,000 requests were batched
    // multi-id resolves; the rest were the per-listing fan-out the prewarm
    // exists to prevent. The deadline now clears the jitter ceiling plus a
    // realistic fetch, and the resolve keeps its own full timeout. This
    // matters MORE now that listing-photo.js refuses to resolve cold listings:
    // for a page of never-seen cards, the prewarm is what puts photos on it.
    // (Little Lady copy) The MLS Grid branch of this prewarm is not copied: this
    // site answers here only while the listings come from Lofty (lib/_backend-mode.js),
    // and it makes no MLS Grid calls.
