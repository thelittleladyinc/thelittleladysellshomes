// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What this site has spent at MLS Grid, hour by hour.
//
// 2026-08-18. Christine's Expired-Luxury app has `/api/admin/mls-usage` and it is
// the single most useful thing any of her three MLS Grid integrations has: it can
// answer "what did we spend in the last hour" from its own records, before MLS
// Grid has to tell it. This site had nothing of the kind, which is the whole
// reason two days went into diagnosing grey photos and NEXT-SESSION §2.6 still
// ended in a guess about a shared quota.
//
// It is also the honest counterpart to the MLS Grid usage tab: theirs is the
// truth for the ACCOUNT (all three apps together), this one is the truth for THIS
// SITE. Comparing the two is the only way to attribute consumption while all
// three apps share one token -- which is exactly the question the support email
// in docs/MLS-GRID-QUOTA.md asks, and this answers half of it without waiting for
// a reply.
//
// Deliberately public and read-only. It exposes counts and byte totals, no
// listing data, no token, no URLs -- nothing that isn't already implied by the
// site being up. Requiring a login would mean Christine cannot check it from her
// phone, which is when she actually wants it.
