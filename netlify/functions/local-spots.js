// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".

// The local-spots layer for the county map: Christine's own videos, pinned to
// the real places they were filmed at.
//
// 2026-08-15 (Christine: "make the map way more detailed for how people would
// find me - based on local spots? I have restaurant videos some wide thousands
// of views on my google reviews of other places").
//
// The map already had a POI layer. It had two pins on it, both golf courses, and
// both playing the CITY OF LOVELAND's promotional videos. That is backwards. The
// reason a buyer should use this map instead of Zillow's is that the person who
// drew it has actually eaten, hiked and ridden in these places and has the
// footage -- her El Pueblito video alone has more views than most of her listing
// tours. So the pins are hers now.
//
// Why this is a function rather than baked into the built page: the pins need
// coordinates, and coordinates come from geocoding an address. Doing that at
// build time would mean either committing coordinates I cannot verify (Google's
// APIs are not reachable from the build environment, so I would be typing in
// numbers from memory -- and a pin 300 metres off puts her recommendation on
// someone else's building), or re-geocoding on every single deploy. Doing it
// here means it happens once per address, ever, and the answer is cached in
// Blobs where it survives deploys.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as sold-homes-geocode.js, which already solved
// this exact problem for her sold-listing pins: same 30-day cache TTL (Google's
// own ceiling for storing Geocoding results, not a tuning knob), same bounded
// concurrency, same time budget sized for Netlify's 10s function timeout.
//
// A spot that cannot be geocoded is simply left out of the response, and the
// reason is logged. Fewer pins is a bad day; a pin in the wrong place is a
// business problem.
