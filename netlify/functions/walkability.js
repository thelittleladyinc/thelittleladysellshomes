// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Powers the "How Walkable Is <town>?" panel on every city and subdivision
// page (see _walkability_block() in build.py).
//
// 2026-08-15 (Christine's request): "a much more detailed walkability score
// -- maybe add more than school, park and grocery store?" The site already
// had a nearby-places.js panel on listing cards covering exactly three
// categories (grocery, school, park). This is the community-page version and
// it looks at ten, weights them, and turns them into a single number plus
// the actual named places behind it.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: this is not Walk Score(R), which is a registered
// trademark and a licensed product of Redfin. Nothing here is derived from
// their data or methodology and the UI never uses their name -- it presents
// this as Christine's own estimate, with the method stated plainly on the
// page. If she ever wants the official score instead, that needs a paid
// Walk Score API subscription plus their required attribution and link-back,
// and would replace this file rather than extend it.
//
// Setup: GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, same key nearby-places.js and
// sold-homes-geocode.js already use (Geocoding API + Places API enabled).
// No key set = {"error":"not_configured"} and the panel hides itself, same
// pattern as every other optional integration here.
//
// Cost: ten Places calls per town, cached 30 days. With 27 city pages and 10
// subdivision pages that is at most ~370 calls a month no matter how much
// traffic the pages get, because the cache is keyed by town rather than by
// visitor.
//
// 30 days is a CEILING set by Google, not a number picked for cost. The Maps
// Platform Service Specific Terms allow lat/lng from the Geocoding API to be
// cached for up to 30 consecutive calendar days and require deletion after
// that; place IDs are the one field exempt from the caching restrictions and
// may be stored indefinitely. Nothing here may cache longer than that, and
// the TTL is checked on read so an entry can never be served stale past it.
