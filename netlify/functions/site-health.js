// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Human-readable "is everything actually working" status page — one URL
// Christine can bookmark and check herself instead of both of us running
// ad-hoc ?debug=true fetches back and forth every time something seems
// off.
//
// 2026-08-17 — THIS HEADER USED TO PROMISE "read-only by default: it never talks
// to MLS Grid or Cloudinary itself ... loading this page is free and can never
// cost API quota, trigger a request, or interfere with the suspension breaker."
// That promise made the page cheap and also made it untrustworthy: the five
// probe-backed rows rendered whatever the last ?probe=1 run concluded, at any age,
// three of them without even printing a date. Christine had fixed her Cloudinary
// credentials the day before and the page still said "cloud_name mismatch"; I read
// it and repeated it to her as current. Her reply set the standard: confirm it is
// valid and live, or there is no reason for the page to exist.
//
// The promise is KEPT — a plain page load still makes no outbound calls and still
// cannot spend API quota or touch the suspension breaker. What changed is that the
// page no longer hides the cost of that choice. Every probe row prints when it was
// checked, a reading older than the TTL is flagged and stops counting as a pass or
// a fail, and a summary row at the top names everything that needs re-checking with
// the one-click way to do it. Honest by default, live in one click.
//
// (I first made the probes refresh themselves. That broke three suites, each
// guarding a lesson already paid for here. Probing was never the missing piece —
// disclosure was. See the note above freshen().)
//
// ONE EXCEPTION, added 2026-08-15 (Christine: "can you confirm that google maps
// is correct api set correct for me?"). Nobody can answer that by reading code:
// the key lives in Netlify's env vars and which APIs are enabled lives in her
// Google Cloud project. So ?google=1 runs two real, tiny probes against her key
// — one Geocoding request and one Places request — and reports Google's own
// status and error_message verbatim, which is the part that actually says which
// API to turn on ("This API project is not authorized to use this API",
// "REQUEST_DENIED", "API key not valid", and so on).
//
// Kept honest about cost: opt-in only (the default page still makes zero
// outbound calls), the result is cached in Blobs for GOOGLE_CHECK_TTL_MS so
// refreshing the page doesn't re-spend quota, and two requests is far inside
// the free tier either way. The key itself is never printed — only whether it
// works.

//
// Five of these checks are live probes whose results are cached in Blobs:
// Google, the photo pipeline, Cloudinary, the Lofty key, the Lofty lead. All five
// were gated behind ?probe=1. Without it, the page rendered whatever the last
// probe concluded -- with NO cap on how old that was, and, for three of the five,
// no date shown at all.
//
// Christine said "I feel like I already did the cloud thing yesterday". She had.
// The page was still reporting the pre-fix verdict, I read it as current, and told
// her it was still broken. Her response is the right standard: confirm it is valid
// and live, or there is no reason for the page to exist.
//
// Three changes make that true:
//
//   1. EVERY probe row now prints when it was checked, in absolute time and in
//      words ("2 days ago"), so an old reading can never again pass for a current
//      one. Three of the five printed no date at all.
//   2. A verdict older than the TTL is flagged loudly AND stops counting as a
//      pass or a fail, because it is neither -- it is a reading about the past. A
//      stale failure that keeps a row red is how I came to tell Christine her
//      Cloudinary credentials were still broken after she had fixed them.
//   3. A summary row at the top of the page names every check whose reading is
//      old or missing, with the one-click way to refresh them. So the page is
//      honest by default and live in one click.
//
//   WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: probe on its own. I tried that first and
//   it broke three suites, each guarding a lesson already paid for -- a page load
//   makes no outbound calls, rows must not go red for things that are not broken
//   ("the crying-wolf mistake the Cloudinary row already taught us"), and a
//   considered cached verdict must not be silently overwritten. Probing was never
//   the missing piece; disclosure was.
//   2. The probes run in PARALLEL. They were sequential awaits; five of them at
//      6-8s of timeout each is 30-40s, well past a function's budget. In parallel
//      the worst case is the slowest single probe, and the whole group is bounded
//      by PROBE_BUDGET_MS so the page always renders.
//   3. Every probe row prints when it was checked, and says so loudly if that is
//      older than the TTL. This is the backstop: a probe can still fail or time
//      out, and then the page falls back to the cached value -- which must never
//      again be presented as if it were current.
// 2026-08-18. This was 6500ms while the photo probe's own steps allowed 6000ms to
// resolve plus 8000ms to fetch an image -- up to 14 seconds for a budget of six and
// a half. So the photo row could essentially never finish inside the group, and
// Christine's page showed every other probe refreshed to the second while "Listing
// photos load end to end" sat at a fifteen-hour-old reading, with no indication
// that the row was structurally incapable of updating rather than merely unlucky.
//
// That is the one row that matters when photos are the problem, and it was the one
// row that could not answer. Raised here, and the photo probe's own steps tightened
// below so the whole chain fits: 3000 + 4500 = 7500 worst case, inside this budget,
// inside Netlify's 10-second function ceiling.
