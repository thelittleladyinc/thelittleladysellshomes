// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Powers the "Nearby & Distances" panel on every listing card (see
// nearbyToggleHtml() / _nearby_places_js_helpers() in build.py) — real
// distance from a specific listing to the nearest grocery stores, schools,
// and parks. Added 2026-08-12 per Christine's request, expanding on the
// earlier walking-distance-to-restaurants idea into three categories with
// a simple button-driven UI (not free-text chat -- confirmed as the right
// scope for v1).
//
// Setup required (one-time, Netlify dashboard -> Site settings ->
// Environment variables): GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, from a Google Cloud project
// with the Geocoding API and Places API enabled, restricted to those two
// APIs (and ideally to this site's domain) so a leaked key can't be abused
// elsewhere. Christine has to create this herself -- Google requires a
// billing-enabled Cloud project even though usage this small stays inside
// the free tier. If the key isn't set yet, this no-ops with
// {"error":"not_configured"}, same pattern as every other optional
// integration on this site (MLSGRID_API_TOKEN, LOFTY_API_KEY, etc.).
//
// Design notes:
// - Straight-line ("as the crow flies") distance, computed ourselves via
//   the haversine formula from the geocoded origin to each place's
//   lat/lng. Kept as the floor that is always present, because it needs no
//   third Google API and therefore cannot fail.
// - 2026-08-16 (Christine: "maybe do a miles minutes to the closest
//   restaurant and gas station"): real DRIVING miles and minutes now come
//   from the Distance Matrix API on top of that, for the nearest result in
//   each category. This is the number people actually asked for -- out here
//   straight-line distance and drive time come apart badly, because a place
//   two miles away across a section of dryland wheat is an eight-mile drive
//   around it. Nunn is the case that makes it matter.
//   Distance Matrix has to be enabled on her Google Cloud key. If it is
//   not, the call returns REQUEST_DENIED, that is logged loudly, and the
//   response still carries straight-line miles -- fewer numbers, never
//   wrong ones.
// - Results are cached in Netlify Blobs, keyed by the normalized address,
//   for 30 days. Grocery stores/schools/parks don't relocate often, and
//   this means the same listing being viewed by 50 different buyers costs
//   Google API quota exactly once, not 50 times.

// each category is one Places call per address, so it's affordable exactly
// because this panel is opened on demand for one listing at a time and cached
// for 30 days. Filtering all 15,000+ stored listings this way is not
// affordable, which is why matchesQuery() has no distance filter -- see the
// note there.

// asks about that this panel could not answer.
