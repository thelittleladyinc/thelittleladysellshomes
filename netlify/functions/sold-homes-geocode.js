// ---- The Little Lady copy (2026-09-30, Signature move, part 1) --------------
// Copied from the Signature repo (signature-property-collection, including its
// 2026-09-30 audit fixes) under the SAME function name, because this site's pages,
// its map and other apps call it by that name. It answers HERE only once Christine
// switches it on -- lib/_backend-mode.js, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md. Until then every
// request passes through to the same function on the Signature site exactly as
// before (lib/_sig-proxy.js). Below this block is the Signature code; anything
// changed for this site is marked "(Little Lady copy)".
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Powers the "Sold Homes Map" (see build_sold_homes_map() in build.py) --
// Christine's request 2026-08-13: map her sold listings with their video
// tours plotted by real address, "using google api". This geocodes her sold
// addresses server-side via Google's Geocoding API, so the map key never
// touches the browser -- same "secret key stays server-side" pattern as
// nearby-places.js.
//
// Setup required (one-time, Netlify dashboard -> Site settings ->
// Environment variables): GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY -- Christine confirmed
// 2026-08-13 she already has one. Same key nearby-places.js already uses
// (needs the Geocoding API enabled on it, which nearby-places.js also
// requires, so if that feature already works this one will too with no
// extra setup). If the key isn't set, this no-ops with
// {"error":"not_configured"}, same pattern as every other optional
// integration on this site.
//
// 2026-08-15 -- CACHE TTL CORRECTED. This used to cache each geocode forever,
// on the reasoning that a street address's lat/lng never changes. That
// reasoning is sound geographically and wrong contractually: Google's Maps
// Platform Service Specific Terms permit caching lat/lng from the Geocoding
// API for up to 30 consecutive calendar days and require deletion after that.
// Place IDs are the only field exempt from the caching restrictions. So the
// cache is now capped at 30 days like nearby-places.js, and entries written
// under the old scheme (which carry no timestamp) are treated as expired and
// re-fetched.
//
// Cost of the correction is small and bounded: one call per address per 30
// days -- for 150 sold homes, about 150 calls a month, comfortably inside the
// free tier. The progressive warming below already handles a partly cold
// cache, so an expiry wave degrades to "fills in over the next couple of page
// loads", not "map goes blank".
//
// 2026-08-14 -- TWO CHANGES, both prompted by Christine asking why only 12
// of her 150+ sales were on the map:
//
// 1. The address list is no longer hand-copied into this file. It used to
//    be, with a comment conceding that "this file needs a manual update any
//    time that list grows -- flagged clearly so it isn't missed". Being
//    flagged did not stop it being missed. It's now generated into
//    lib/_sold-homes-data.json by build.py from build/data/sold_homes.json,
//    the same source the page itself is built from, so the two cannot
//    disagree. A pin no longer requires a YouTube tour to exist either --
//    videoId is optional in that file.
//
// 2. That list is now expected to run to 150+ entries rather than 12, which
//    breaks the old "Promise.all over every address at once" approach on a
//    cold cache: 150 simultaneous outbound calls invites Google's rate
//    limiter, and a function that tries to finish all of them in one
//    invocation hits Netlify's execution ceiling and returns nothing (the
//    same failure mode already fixed once in sync-listings.js, see its
//    2026-08-14 timeout commit). So geocoding is now bounded on three axes:
//    a small concurrency window, a per-request timeout, and an overall time
//    budget after which no NEW lookups start. Whatever is already cached
//    always returns immediately and in full, so the map is never empty
//    while the cache warms -- it fills in over the first couple of loads
//    and is permanent from then on. The response reports pending work so
//    the client can pick up the rest without a page refresh.
