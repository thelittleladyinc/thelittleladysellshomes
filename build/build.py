# The previous AgentFire/WordPress site's URL structure, mapped to where each page
# lives now.
#
# 2026-08-17. Source: Christine's own Search Console "Crawled - currently not
# indexed" export (66 URLs). Reading it rather than theorising about it is the
# whole point -- 59 of those 66 turned out to be OLD site URLs, last crawled
# between February and July 2026, i.e. while WordPress was still serving them.
# Google holds that verdict until it re-crawls, and a re-crawl that 404s throws
# away whatever authority the URL had accumulated.
#
# 56 of them have a real equivalent on this site, so they get a 301 instead. That
# is the difference between inheriting the old site's equity and starting from
# zero -- and this repo has a documented reason to care: the README records that a
# 2023 change to thelittleladysellshomes.com "destroyed years of organic traffic"
# with no root cause ever found.
#
# Three shape changes account for nearly all of it:
#   /communities/explore-weld-county/windsor/  ->  /communities/weld/windsor.html
#   /explore-boulder-county/                   ->  /communities/boulder.html
#   /5-myths-that-scare-buyers-but-shouldnt/   ->  /blog/<same-slug>.html
#
# Every destination below was verified to exist on disk at build time by the guard
# under this dict -- a redirect to a 404 is worse than the 404 it replaced, because
# it looks deliberate.
#
# Deliberately NOT redirected, because no honest equivalent exists:
#   /sitemap/  -- WordPress's HTML sitemap page. The XML sitemap is not a
#                 user-facing page, and sending a person to the homepage instead
#                 is a soft 404. Let it 404.

AGENT_ID = SITE["domain"] + "/#christine-gwinnup"
ORG_ID = SITE["domain"] + "/#the-little-lady-sells-homes"

# Off-site profiles that are the SAME entity as AGENT_ID. Two jobs here:
#
#  1. Consolidation. Christine's real authority -- 99 five-star Google
#     reviews, BBB A+, the NoCo Real Producers feature, Yelp, Zillow --
#     accrued under "Christine Gwinnup" and "The Little Lady Sells Homes".
#     Listing them as sameAs is how you tell a machine those profiles and
#     this site are one person, so that authority consolidates here.
#
#  2. Disambiguation, which matters more than usual: "Signature Property
#     Collection" collides with several other Colorado real-estate
#     "Signature" brands, so the person-level corroboration is what makes
#     the entity resolvable.
#
# 2026-08-14, corrected same day per Christine: she now holds only TWO
# brands -- The Little Lady Sells Homes and The Little Lady Sells Homes.
# boldcollectivehomes.com was previously listed here and has been REMOVED:
# it is no longer hers, and a sameAs is an assertion that a URL represents
# the same entity. Pointing it at a site she does not control would tie her
# entity to whatever that domain becomes, which is worse than omitting it.
#
# thelittleladysellshomes.com stays. She still owns it, and while the
# business is luxury-only under The Little Lady Sells Homes, the Little
# Lady brand is where a large share of her real authority accrued (reviews,
# BBB, press, every social handle). Listing it consolidates that authority
# here. If and when it is 301'd into this domain and Google has re-crawled,
# remove it -- a sameAs pointing at a URL that redirects back to you is
# noise rather than signal.
# The sister LUXURY brand's site. Same person, two brands with a deliberate
# intent split: this site owns general "homes for sale in X" search demand,
# Signature owns luxury/$950K+ demand. sameAs consolidates her entity across
# both without mixing their keyword intent.

# 2026-08-13 (Christine's request, live-site walkthrough): the "cities"
# lists below used to only cover a handful of well-known towns per county
# (e.g. Boulder County had just 4 -- Boulder, Lafayette, Louisville,
# Nederland -- when it actually has 10 incorporated municipalities), which
# meant the Search Homes CITY dropdown was missing real towns a buyer might
# search for. Expanded every county's list to its full set of incorporated
# cities/towns, sourced from each county government's own site (Larimer,
# Boulder, Weld, Adams) or Jefferson/Arapahoe county profiles + Wikipedia's
# List of municipalities in Colorado, cross-checked 2026-08-13. Cities added
# here without a CITY_DATA_SLUG entry safely render as plain (non-linked)
# pills on county pages and as filter-only options in Search Homes -- see
# _city_url()'s fallback and CITY_DATA_SLUG's own comment above -- so this
# doesn't require writing new content pages for every small town, just
# widens what people can actually search/filter by.

# Christine confirmed (Aug 2026) she and Kendra Bajcar work as a duo, so the four
# reviews naming Kendra as co-agent are accurate and included above. The second
# Rhonda Beach quote (2026-08-14, sourced from Christine's official "Signature
# Listing Strategy" marketing brochure) is a distinct, genuine review focused
# specifically on Kendra -- not a duplicate of her earlier, shorter quote above
# it, which predates Kendra's review. Google Business Profiles are per-agent,
# so the same client leaving separate reviews on Christine's and Kendra's
# individual profiles is expected, not an error.

# Manually curated: video tours matched to the exact street address they were
# filmed at, so the live listing showcase (see build_current_listings() and
# the blog-post spotlight widget) can auto-embed a real video tour for that
# specific property instead of just a photo — but ONLY when it's genuinely
# the same house, never a lookalike/nearby one. Matched against the live MLS
# listing's own StreetNumber + StreetName + StreetSuffix (see mapListing() in
# netlify/functions/listings-search.js), lowercased.
#
# Pulled 2026-08-11 from Christine's own YouTube channel (@thelittleladysellshomes,
# via vidIQ) — every long-form or Shorts title that named a specific street
# address. Since we can't query her live MLS Grid feed from here to see IRES's
# exact StreetName/StreetSuffix spelling/abbreviation for each of these, each
# entry below lists a few plausible spelling variants (e.g. "dr" vs "drive",
# with/without a directional like "w"/"west") — worst case an unmatched variant
# just means no video shows for that address (falls back to a photo, same as
# any other listing), never a video attached to the wrong property. This list
# only matters at all for addresses that are CURRENTLY active in MLS — most of
# these are older/likely-sold videos, so most entries here will simply never
# match anything live, which is fine and expected.
#
# Add a new entry any time Christine films a new listing tour and wants it
# auto-attached once that address hits the live MLS feed — video ID + title
# from YouTube, address variants lowercase.
#
# `status` drives whether the site claims a home was SOLD, so it is now the most
# load-bearing field in this file. Four values:
#
#   "sold"         Christine's own records say it closed. This is the ONLY value that
#                  puts a home on the sold-homes map or in the "How I Sold These
#                  Homes" showcase on /past-sales.html.
#   "live"         Currently listed. Excluded from any sold framing -- showing an
#                  active seller's home in a "sold" section is both wrong and awkward
#                  for that client.
#   "not-sold"     Listed and did not sell. Excluded from everything sold-related.
#   "unconfirmed"  We do not actually know. Treated exactly like "not-sold" until
#                  Christine says otherwise.
#
# 2026-08-16, and this is the important part. Until today "sold" meant something much
# weaker: on 2026-08-11 these were cross-checked against her "Each Listing SOP" sheet
# and anything NOT appearing there as Stage = Live was recorded as sold -- "it doesn't
# appear, meaning as far as we can tell that listing has closed or moved on".
#
# That inference is unsound, and "moved on" is doing the lying. A listing absent from
# a live-listings sheet may have closed, expired, been withdrawn, or never gone live.
# Christine read the site today and said: "32 victoria was not sold either was
# homestead". Both were marked sold by that inference, and both were therefore being
# published as her past sales -- pins on the sold-homes map and tiles in the showcase.
# Two wrong out of the twelve she could check.
#
# So the eight entries whose only evidence was that inference are no longer claimed.
# Four remain "sold", each with real evidence:
#   504 Graefe Ave, 4869 Stuart St, 5705 Snow Mesa Ct -- listed with a sale year on
#     Christine's own sold-listings page (see sold_homes.json, added 2026-08-15).
#   913 Green Mountain Dr -- confirmed directly with her on 2026-08-11.
#
# The rule going forward: "sold" requires evidence from Christine, not an absence of
# evidence to the contrary. tests/test-soldclaims.js enforces it -- every "sold" entry
# must have a matching sold_homes.json pin, and no other status may appear in any sold
# framing anywhere on the site.
#
# Status is a label for OUR display logic only — it never affects live MLS matching
# itself, which always checks the real feed regardless of what's recorded here.

# ------------------------------------------------- HER TOURS, BY TOWN ----
# 2026-08-16 (Christine: "then we can put videos of listing ive sold on each town
# page?").
#
# Every listing-tour video on her channel that names a town, pulled from vidIQ on
# 2026-08-16 and grouped by that town. This is the answer to the question a seller
# actually asks -- "what would you do for MY house, here?" -- with the work itself
# rather than a claim about it. Until now a town page could show at most one video,
# and only for the ten towns in CITY_VIDEOS; Nunn had five tours and showed none of
# them.
#
# View counts are captured here so the data is auditable, but they are deliberately
# NOT rendered in this block. Christine's own words, 2026-08-16: "why would anyone
# care about how many views?" A buyer reading a town page cares that the tour is
# real and local; the view count is channel-performance data for her, not a selling
# point for them.
#
# `property_key` groups videos of the SAME house, and it is the reason this is a
# 4-tuple rather than a 3-tuple. Christine filmed 945 Maplebrook in Windsor three
# separate times and 475 Homestead in Johnstown twice; without grouping, a section
# headed "Homes Christine Has Marketed In Windsor" showed one house three times and
# read as padding. One video per property is shown -- the most-watched.
#
# A key of None means "cannot confirm which house this is", and those are left
# ungrouped on purpose. Merging two videos that turn out to be different homes hides
# real work; keeping them apart, at worst, shows one home twice. Where the address is
# not in the title it was read off the video's own transcript (noted inline).

#
# The map used to be built straight from the "sold"-status rows of
# _LISTING_VIDEO_ENTRIES above. That list exists to match YouTube listing
# TOURS to addresses, so a home could only ever get a pin if Christine had
# also filmed and uploaded a video for it. It was a map of "sold homes I
# happened to film", displayed under copy that claimed it was her track
# record. Twelve of 150+.
#
# The pin list now comes from build/data/sold_homes.json instead, where the
# video is optional and the minimum viable entry is an address plus a city.
# The sold video entries above are still merged in automatically, so no pin
# that used to appear can be lost by an editing slip in the JSON — and any
# video entry missing from the JSON prints a build warning rather than
# silently geocoding without a city (which is how a pin lands on the wrong
# "Main St" in the wrong town).

def _paced_photo_js():
    """The queue that keeps listing-card photos under MLS Grid's speed limit.

    2026-08-18: MLS Grid sent two API Access Warnings in one afternoon, both
    reading "your hourly 5.0 requests per second exceeded the 2 requests per
    second limit" -- and both stamped with the exact hours Christine was
    testing the search page. The burst was the page itself: 12 listing cards
    share one HTTP/2 connection, so the browser fires every /listing-photo
    request in the same instant, and every first-ever photo becomes a live
    MLS Grid fetch. loading="lazy" does not stagger images that are already
    near the viewport, so 12-at-once read as 5+ rps against a 2 rps
    account-wide ceiling shared with her other two apps. Warnings escalate to
    suspension at 6 rps (suspended 2026-08-01 and again 2026-08-12), so this
    is the difference between a warning email and a dead site.

    The fix: card images carry data-src instead of src, an
    IntersectionObserver enqueues each one only as it approaches the viewport
    (off-screen cards still cost nothing, same as lazy loading), and the
    queue lets at most 2 images load at once. Photos already in our own
    store return in ~100ms so the queue drains almost invisibly; only
    first-ever photos are slow, and 2-in-flight is a pace the shared limit
    can absorb. A failed image -- usually listing-photo.js's deliberate 1-2
    minute cooldown after MLS Grid says "too fast" -- retries once after 80s
    with a cache-busting param, so grey squares heal without a reload.

    # or if its esquetarian or walking distance to a coffee shop or how far from
    # a grocery store?"
    #
    # Everything here is a filter the stored data can answer for real. Two of
    # her four examples are answered elsewhere on purpose, and it matters that
    # the reason is written down rather than rediscovered later:
    #
    #   - Riverfront was already supported end-to-end in matchesQuery() and had
    #     simply never been given a control. It's now a checkbox.
    #   - Equestrian is new: a pre-computed keyword flag (see slimForStorage in
    #     sync-listings.js for why it can't be a query-time remarks scan).
    #   - Coffee/grocery DISTANCE is not a filter and shouldn't be. Filtering
    #     15,000+ listings by proximity means a Google Places lookup per
    #     listing, against a per-address 30-day cache ceiling -- thousands of
    #     calls to answer one search. It lives where it's affordable instead:
    #     the per-listing "What's Nearby" panel (on demand, cached 30 days,
    #     now including Coffee and Dining tabs) and the town-level walkability
    #     panel on every community page.
    #

    # searches, and a wall of filters is the thing that makes IDX search pages
    # feel like software instead of like help. No JS needed to open it.

    beds/baths filters, replacing the old plain dropdown/number-box search
    form (Christine's request 2026-08-11 — 'a slider and more fancy ways
    that are easy to use for buyers and sellers'). Backed by the same
    /.netlify/functions/listings-search endpoint as everything else here.

    wid: short id prefix (e.g. "fs") — keeps element ids unique if a page
    ever needed two of these (none currently does, but cheap insurance).

    search_cities: full list of searchable city names for the City dropdown.
    Only used when fixed_city is None.

    fixed_city: when set, this widget is scoped to one city (city pages) —
    no dropdown, just a hidden field, and the results are pre-filtered to
    that city from the first search.

    support_deep_links: when True (search-homes.html only), the widget also
    reads ?city=&minPrice=&subdivision=&waterfront=true&cities=&noFloor=true
    from the URL on load — the deep-link contract other pages (subdivision
    guides, the homepage map popup) already link into. City-page instances
    don't need this since they're not a deep-link target themselves.

    price_floor: slider's minimum handle position (defaults to the site's
    $950K luxury floor). Pass 0 for a widget that should search the full
    market, not just the luxury tier — see search-homes.html (2026-08-13,
    Christine's request): the hardcoded floor was silently hiding
    non-luxury inventory from the page meant to capture general search
    traffic, and its "go search somewhere else" copy was working against
    that goal, not for it.

    always_no_floor: when True, every search this widget runs sends
    noFloor=true to listings-search.js regardless of where the slider
    happens to sit — needed alongside price_floor=0 because matchesQuery()
    in _mls-shared.js enforces LUXURY_PRICE_FLOOR unless that flag is
    explicitly set; a $0 minimum on the slider doesn't imply it on its own.

    counties: optional list of {"slug", "name", "cities"} dicts (a subset
    of COUNTIES) — when given (and fixed_city is None), renders a County
    dropdown next to City that narrows City's own options and, when a
    county is picked with City left on "All", searches every city in that
    county at once via listings-search.js's existing `cities` param
    (already supported server-side — no backend change needed)."""

    # 2026-08-15 (Christine: "i also want them to be able to pick mu;tiple towns

# card itself explaining that history, so a visitor just sees Kendra
# pitching a differently-named, unexplained brand on Christine's own site.

# (g.page/r/... -- the permanent public share link she pulled from Google
# Business Profile's own "Share profile" flow, not a session-tied search
# URL) instead of the internal /testimonials.html page, so the reviews
# stat takes visitors to the actual Google reviews, not just a page about
# them. Opens in a new tab (external site) so visitors don't lose their
# place on the site.
#
# 2026-08-14 (later still, per Christine's official "Signature Listing
# Strategy" brochure): reviews/homes/volume updated from Christine's solo
# figures to her and Kendra Bajcar's combined-team numbers (158 reviews,
# 250+ homes, $200M+ volume) -- Christine confirmed 2026-08-15 that 250+ is

# the brochure's more conservative $100M+ before she corrected it).
#
# 2026-08-14 (final polish pass): dropped the "/review" suffix from the
# g.page link. Verified directly (fetched both variants) that
# g.page/r/<code>/review forces Google's sign-in-then-write-a-review
# compose flow -- exactly wrong for a "see the reviews" stat, since a

    """WebSite node, for Google's Site Names feature. Homepage only.

    2026-08-16 (findability audit). Two things are true about WebSite schema and
    most audits get them backwards, so the reasoning is written down here rather
    than left as a judgement call for the next person:

    1. The sitelinks SEARCH BOX is dead. Google announced its deprecation on
       2024-10-21 and retired it globally on 2024-11-21. The `potentialAction`
       / `SearchAction` block that every SEO checklist still tells you to add
       produces nothing at all now. It is deliberately NOT emitted here. It
       would also have been a lie in this specific case: search-homes.html
       accepts `cities`/`city`/`subdivision`, not free text, so a searchbox
       template would have handed Google a URL that silently returns nothing
       for any real query a person types.

    2. WebSite schema itself is NOT dead. Google explicitly kept a variation
       alive for Site Names -- the name shown above the URL in a result. That
       is the whole reason this function exists, and it matters more than usual
       here for the same reason _organization_schema() documents: "Signature
       Property Collection" collides with at least six other Colorado real
       estate "Signature" brands. Declaring the name and its short form is how
       the site gets to state which one it is instead of letting Google guess

<!-- Only the faces that render above-the-fold text are preloaded: preloading
     all five would push the CSS and hero behind 150KB of fonts on slow
     connections. `crossorigin` is required on font preloads even same-origin,
     or the browser fetches the file twice. The @font-face rules live at the
     top of style.css.

       abril-fatface  --font-display  .hero h1        (the LCP element)
       open-sans      --font-sans     body text
       yellowtail     --font-script   .brand-mark, .eyebrow

     2026-08-25: yellowtail is deliberately NOT here, and this is the second
     time that has needed deciding, so here is the measurement. A Lighthouse
     critical-chain trace makes it look like an obvious omission -- it comes
     back as the LONGEST node in the chain, discovered only once the CSS is
     parsed, and it renders the header wordmark and the hero eyebrow, both
     above the fold. Adding it, 3 runs each side, median of 3:

       FCP  -149ms      SI  -149ms      LCP  +150ms      score 99 -> 98

     It wins the paint it is visible in and loses the one that counts. A third
     preload competes with abril-fatface, and abril-fatface sets .hero h1, which
     IS the LCP element -- so preloading yellowtail buys a faster wordmark by
     delaying the headline. LCP is weighted 25% and FCP 10%, so this is a real
     trade and it loses. Yellowtail arrives fine on its own with font-display:
     swap; the wordmark just renders in the fallback for a moment.

     The two Playfair faces stay out for the simpler reason. They are
     --font-serif: cards, FAQ answers, testimonials. Nothing they set is above
     the fold, and they are the two heaviest files (39KB each) -- preloading
     them is exactly the 150KB stampede this comment warns about. -->

    # entirely below 900px (`nav.primary-nav { display: none; }`) with no
    # replacement -- confirmed via a full site review that there was no
    # hamburger button in this markup, no toggle CSS, and no JS anywhere in
    # the built site to show one. That meant every visitor on a phone or
    # narrow tablet (the majority of real-estate site traffic) landed with
    # NO way to reach Communities, Search Homes, Current Listings, Buy,
    # Sell, Testimonials, or Contact except the browser back button. Fixed
    # with a standard hamburger toggle: a button (hidden on desktop, shown
    # under 900px via CSS in style.css) that reveals the nav as a dropdown
    # panel. Vanilla JS, no dependencies, mirrors the same
    # inline-script-per-page pattern already used elsewhere on this site
    # (e.g. the homepage's lazy Instagram embed loader).
    #
    # 2026-08-13 (logo asset fix, take 2): logo-mark.png is a NEW asset --
    # logo.png (the file previously used here) turned out to NOT be a clean
    # script-only mark despite looking that way in an image viewer. It has
    # "PROPERTY COLLECTION" baked in as solid OPAQUE WHITE text beneath
    # "Signature" -- invisible against a white preview background (which is
    # why it looked clean), but fully visible once placed on this header's
    # rose/mauve background, and doubly so once brightness(0) invert(1)
    # (below) turns the rose script white too. Confirmed live on the
    # deployed site: it rendered as two stacked "Property Collection"
    # captions, the hidden one baked into logo.png plus this real <span>.
    # logo-mark.png was generated by masking every near-white pixel out of
    # logo.png to fully transparent (keeping only the rose-colored script,
    # including its low descenders) -- so it is genuinely script-only at
    # any background color, and safe to pair with the real <span> below.
    # logo.png and logo-full.png are both left alone (logo-full.png is
    # still used for OG/social meta images, see head()).
    #
    # 2026-08-14 (Christine: "I want screenshot top left logo to actually be
    # my real logo found in drive"): traced this to ground first rather than
    # assuming the header was using a fake/placeholder mark -- it wasn't.
    # logo-mark.png (above) is already a pixel-identical crop of her real
    # Drive file (rose_primary_01.png in Logo/Rose Color/PNG). What the
    # header was actually missing was her diamond "PC" monogram/logomark --
    # the more distinctly logo-like brand asset -- so this adds it as a
    # small badge to the left of the existing script wordmark. Pulled the
    # real vector (Logo/Rose Color/SVG/Logomark_01.svg) rather than a raster
    # export so it stays crisp at this small header size. Left in its
    # natural two-tone black+rose coloring (unlike brand-logo/brokerage-logo
    # above, this one does NOT get brightness(0) invert(1) -- that filter
    # would flatten it to solid white and erase the rose accent that makes
    # it read as a monogram rather than a blob) on a small white badge
    # backing so both colors keep contrast against the header's rose
    # background, echoing the badge treatment already used for the LPT mark.

# with no code change and nothing for me to get wrong on her behalf.

#   1. The FOOTER, because it is already on every page -- phone, text and email

    # 2026-08-16, on the H1. It read "Turning Dreams Into Addresses" -- a nice line that
    # nobody types into anything. A homepage H1 is among the strongest signals a page has,
    # for Google and for an answer engine deciding what this site IS, and it was spending
    # that signal on a slogan, so the page named its own market nowhere in its largest
    # text. Now it carries the terms people actually search and the coverage stated the way
    # Christine states it herself: Denver north. The slogan keeps the eyebrow, where it
    # costs nothing.
    #
    # Kept as a Python comment, not an HTML one: HTML comments ship, and build notes
    # quoting Christine's own words do not belong in a page a client can View Source on.
    # ---- Homepage lead capture (2026-08-20) -------------------------------
    #
    # GA4, trailing 12 months, filtered to this hostname: the homepage took
    # 1,736 sessions at 213s average engagement -- people arrive and they stay
    # three and a half minutes -- and the page contained zero <form> elements
    # and no clickable phone number above the footer. Every path off the hero
    # was a link to another page that then had to earn the contact all over
    # again. The highest-intent traffic on the site had nowhere to convert.
    #
    # Three additions, in the order a visitor actually needs them:
    #
    #   1. A real search, in the hero. Not a link to search -- a working town +
    #      budget form. It is a plain GET form pointed at /search-homes.html,
    #      which already reads `cities`, `maxPrice` and `beds` as deep-link
    #      params (see the supportDeepLinks block in _fancy_search_widget), so
    #      submitting lands on pre-filtered results with the pickers checked and
    #      editable. No JavaScript, so it works before hydration and if a script
    #      fails.
    #   2. The phone number, visible and tappable, next to the search. Most of
    #      her business arrives by phone; making a caller hunt the footer for
    #      the number is a self-inflicted wound.
    #   3. One lead form on the page, for the visitor who is not ready to browse
    #      and does not want to call.

# Christine: "can you review the ones the did index conmpared to the ones they didnt
# and then make the rest much better?"
#
# Measured rather than guessed. An audit of all 144 built pages against her Search
# Console coverage export (39 indexed, 62 "Crawled - currently not indexed") found
# the cause is structural, not editorial:
#
#   * 31 town pages each had exactly ONE inbound internal link -- their county page.
#     They are NOT thin: 650-940 unique non-template words each, well above the
#     median. Google had read them and declined to index them, which is what it does
#     with pages nothing on the site treats as important.
#   * /communities/index.html -- the hub, with 144 inbound links of its own -- linked
#     the 20 COUNTY pages and not one of the 31 town pages. All that authority stopped
#     one level short of the pages that actually target searches like "homes for sale
#     in Timnath".
#   * The same for the 10 Loveland subdivision pages: 1 inbound link each.
#
# So the fix is links, not words. Two blocks below: the hub now lists every town, and
# every town links its siblings. That takes each town page from 1 inbound link to
# roughly 6-11 and puts all of them two clicks from the homepage instead of three.

# Towns where "Luxury Homes For Sale" is the wrong title, and actively costs her.
#
# 2026-08-16. Every one of the 36 town pages carried "<Town> Luxury Homes For Sale",
# a template set on 2026-08-14 to fix a real gap (the phrase "luxury homes" appeared
# nowhere on the site). It works for Fort Collins, Windsor and Erie. It does not work
# for a prairie community with no store, and building Carr and Pierce made that
# impossible to ignore: "Carr Luxury Homes For Sale" is what Google would show to
# someone searching "land for sale carr co", and they would not click it. Christine had
# already flagged the same thing on Nunn.
#
# Two failures at once. A visitor bounces on the mismatch, and Google reads a title
# promising luxury over a page that honestly describes wells, septic and a twelve-mile
# drive for dinner -- which is the page it should rank, for the search people are
# really making.
#
# So these towns get a title naming what is actually for sale. They keep every other
# word of their content; only the title and description change. This is a judgement
# about market tier, so it is an explicit list rather than anything inferred.
# Just the middle phrase -- the town name and the county suffix are added by
# _town_title, exactly as they are for the luxury template, so every town page's title
# has the same shape. Appending the brand here instead produced titles that were
# sometimes 30 characters and sometimes 57, because _fit_title strips the brand only
# when the whole thing runs past 60.
# 2026-08-18 (brand separation, at Christine's direction): she runs a second,
# non-luxury site — thelittleladysellshomes.com — and bare "Homes For Sale" is
# THE generic entry-level phrase that site exists to win. This site should not
# bid against it. The four towns below that said plain "Homes For Sale" now say
# what this site's inventory in those towns actually is — country property and
# acreage — which is both truer to the luxury/acreage brand and leaves the
# generic intent to the sister site on purpose.

# - Estes Park's demand is visiting and second homes, not relocation ("things

    2026-08-16 (Christine, on the block that used to be here: "why is it even there?!!!
    Who cares about that! Lets make it what people are actually searching for!").

    She was right. What was here counted how many town PAGES this website has and how
    many places she had filmed -- the site talking about itself. Nobody searches that.

    What people actually type is "best places to live in larimer county", "how far is
    Loveland from Denver", "what school district is Timnath in". Those are three
    different searches with one answer shape: a comparison of the towns.

    2026-08-16, second pass (Christine: "Places shes filmed?!!!!! What! that is
    awful"). My first fix kept a fourth column listing the places she had filmed in
    each town, and it was wrong twice over. It made the agent the subject of a table a
    buyer opened to compare TOWNS. And because it was honestly empty where she has no
    footage, five of ten Larimer rows showed a dash -- so a table headed "which town
    fits you" quietly said she had never been to Estes Park, Timnath, Masonville or
    Windsor. Windsor and Timnath are towns she works. Her filmed spots already have a
    home on the town pages and the county map, where they answer "what is this place
    like" instead of "how much has she filmed here".

    So: three columns, every one of them the buyer's question, and sorted
    alphabetically rather than by how much footage she has -- a reader looking for
    Wellington should find it where a list puts Wellington.

      1. Does the MLS feed actually return listings here? -> a factual
         question about coverage, and the only thing the search UI should
         depend on.
      2. Is this one of the farm areas we claim to know block by block? -> a
         marketing claim about Christine's own business.

    They were identical for the first 8 counties, so nothing forced them
    apart until Morgan. Christine confirmed she can pull Morgan listings in
    IRES, so Morgan gets the live search -- but she never claimed Fort Morgan,
    Brush and Wiggins as core farm areas, and the county page's "we know this
    market block by block" line is hers to make, not ours to infer from a
    search setting. So: live_search here, priority stays with the claim.

    Defaults to priority so the other 8 counties are untouched.

    2026-08-16 (Christine: "maybe do a miles minutes to the closest restaurant and
    gas station"). It is the first question a buyer asks about a small town and the
    one the site could not answer -- the county comparison table gives drive time to
    Denver and Fort Collins, which is the question people ask about a COMMUTE, not
    about a Tuesday evening.

    Filled in the browser from nearby-places.js rather than written into the page,
    and that is a deliberate trade with a real cost. Google's Places data is current
    and mine is not: I checked Nunn while building this and found its cafe listed
    both as open and as permanently closed, at the same address, by two sources on
    the same day. Numbers typed into a town page go stale silently and are then
    quoted back to a buyer by an agent who trusted them. The cost is that Google
    cannot index an answer that arrives by fetch, so this does not win the search
    for "nearest gas station to Nunn" -- if that trade should go the other way for a
    town, the fix is real verified prose in city_content.json, which is where Great
    Guns Sporting went for exactly that reason.

    Asks for two categories, not six -- see the `only` parameter in the function.

# ------------------------------------------------- CONCIERGE EXPERIENCE ---
# 2026-08-14: the second of Christine's three picks. Buyers/Sellers/home
# copy has referenced "private showings," "off-market access," "white-glove
# relocation," and "concierge" repeatedly (see build_buyers()'s hero and the
# homepage services grid) without ever having one real page that actually
# walks through what that means -- a luxury buyer/seller comparing agents
# reads exactly this kind of page. Deliberately stays inside claims already
# established elsewhere on the site (staging, cinematic/drone marketing,
# private showings, single point of contact, VA loan familiarity,
# negotiation credentials) rather than inventing new specific promises
# (guaranteed timelines, named vendors) that aren't backed up anywhere.

# list that did not need a login. Set expectations honestly: Google dropped FAQ
# rich results for everyone and removed the report and Rich Results Test support
# in June 2026, so none of this buys a SERP feature. It is written for the

# the questions Christine actually gets asked, answered the way she answers them
# rather than the way a brochure would.
#
# Deliberately no invented figures. Where an answer wants a number that moves
# (days on market, median price, commission), it points at the live page that
# carries it instead of freezing one here. Same rule as the relocation PDF.
BUYERS_FAQ = [
    ("I've never bought a home before. Where do I even start?",
     "With a conversation, not a mortgage application. Christine guides first-time "
     "buyers through every step — what pre-approval actually involves, what you can "
     "genuinely afford versus what a lender will approve, how showings and offers work, "
     "and what happens between contract and keys. No question is too basic, and the "
     "first meeting costs nothing and commits you to nothing."),
    ("Do you work with VA loans?",
     "Yes, regularly. Veterans and active-duty buyers are a meaningful share of "
     "Christine's business, and she knows how VA loans actually behave in this market — "
     "including how to write a VA-backed offer that sellers take seriously, and what "
     "the appraisal and inspection process looks like on a VA purchase."),
    ("Who pays my agent when I buy a home?",
     "It is negotiated, and it is worth asking about early rather than assuming. Since "
     "the industry rule changes of 2024, buyer-agent compensation is no longer "
     "advertised through the MLS and is agreed in writing between you and your agent "
     "before you tour homes — the seller may still contribute, but that is a term of "
     "the deal rather than a given. Christine will put the actual numbers for your "
     "situation in front of you before you sign anything, not after."),
    ("Can I buy a home here before I move to Colorado?",
     "Yes, and roughly half of the buyers here do. The workable version is a scouting "
     "trip to choose the town, then a focused touring trip, with honest video "
     "walkthroughs in between. What you should not do is waive an inspection to win a "
     "bidding war on a house you have only seen on a screen. The free Northern Colorado "
     "Relocation Guide covers the whole sequence."),
    ("What should I know about metro districts and HOA dues in new construction?",
     "This is the most common unpleasant surprise in new builds here, especially in "
     "Weld County. Many master-planned neighbourhoods sit inside a metropolitan "
     "district that adds a mill levy to your property tax to repay infrastructure "
     "bonds, on top of any HOA dues — so two similar houses in two neighbourhoods can "
     "carry very different annual costs. It is disclosed and legal, and easy to miss. "
     "Ask for the mill levy and the district's debt service, and read them next to the "
     "HOA budget."),
    ("Is buying acreage with a well and septic a bad idea?",
     "No, but it is a different diligence list. Well permits limit what you may use the "
     "water for — a household-use-only permit does not cover irrigating pasture or "
     "watering livestock — and septic systems generally need an inspection when a "
     "property changes hands, with a failure running into five figures. Both are "
     "manageable when you know before you are under contract, which is the entire "
     "point of asking early."),
    ("How current are the listings on this site?",
     "They come straight from the IRES MLS feed and refresh every 15 minutes, which is "
     "why every town page can show that town's live active count and median asking "
     "price rather than a number typed in once. It is the same data Christine sees."),
]

SELLERS_FAQ = [
    ("What does it cost to sell a home in Northern Colorado?",
     "Commission is negotiable and always has been — there is no standard rate, and any "
     "site that quotes you one is quoting itself. Beyond commission, budget for title "
     "and closing costs, any pre-listing work you choose to do, and a possible "
     "concession after inspection. Christine will give you a written net-proceeds "
     "estimate for your actual address before you list, so you are deciding on a real "
     "number rather than a percentage."),
    ("How long will my home take to sell?",
     "It depends far more on pricing than on the market, and the honest answer changes "
     "month to month — which is why the current regional days-on-market and "
     "sale-to-list figures live on the monthly Northern Colorado market report "
     "rather than being frozen into this page. What is consistent: strategic pricing "
     "is what decides whether a home trades inside 60 days or sits for six "
     "months, at every price point."),
    ("Is a pre-listing inspection worth it?",
     "Usually, on an older or higher-priced home. It costs a few hundred dollars and it "
     "moves the discovery of problems from the middle of your contract — where they "
     "become a renegotiation you are losing — to before you list, where they are just "
     "repairs you chose to make. The one real downside is that anything you find you "
     "then have to disclose, which is a reason to be deliberate about it, not a reason "
     "to avoid knowing."),
    ("My home didn't sell last time. What would be different?",
     "Almost always one of three things: the price, the photography and marketing, or "
     "the showing access. An expired listing is not a verdict on the house. There is a "
     "whole page on this site about relisting a home that did not sell the first "
     "time, including what to change and what to leave alone."),
    ("Do you handle staging and photography, or do I arrange that?",
     "Christine handles it. Professional photography and real video go on every single "
     "listing — not just the expensive ones — with staging guidance that photographs "
     "the way the home actually lives. The listing video portfolio on this site is real "
     "work on real homes, not a showreel from a vendor."),
]

RELOCATION_FAQ = [
    ("Which Northern Colorado town should I move to?",
     "It depends on the four things people ask about before houses: the schools, the "
     "drive, what is being built, and what it costs. Broadly — Boulder County is the "
     "most expensive tier; Fort Collins, Timnath and Windsor sit above Loveland and "
     "Greeley; Wellington, Severance and the smaller Weld County towns are where new "
     "construction meets accessible pricing; and the foothills communities trade "
     "commute for views and acreage. Every town page on this site answers all four for "
     "that specific town, and the free relocation guide puts them side by side."),
    ("How long is the commute from Northern Colorado to Denver or Boulder?",
     "Far more dependent on which side of I-25 you live on than on raw distance. Rather "
     "than generalise, each town page carries measured drive times for that town — to "
     "Denver, Boulder, and the Fort Collins and Greeley job centres — plus drive times "
     "to the nearest everyday things like a grocery store or a gas station, which is "
     "the figure that actually decides how a small town feels to live in."),
    ("What surprises people who move to Colorado from out of state?",
     "Five things, in rough order of expense: metropolitan districts adding to property "
     "tax in new-build neighbourhoods; well permits that limit what you may use your "
     "own water for; septic systems needing inspection at transfer; radon, which is "
     "common along the Front Range and routine to mitigate; and wildfire risk changing "
     "what insurance costs — or whether it is available — in the foothills. None are "
     "hidden. They just do not exist where most people are moving from."),
    ("Can you help before I'm ready to buy?",
     "That is generally the most useful time. Choosing the town is the decision that is "
     "hard to reverse, and it happens months before you need an agent. Christine left "
     "Loveland and chose to come back, so she has actually made this decision in both "
     "directions — including telling people a different town fits them better."),
    ("Is there a cost for relocation help?",
     "No. There is no fee to talk it through, no charge for the guide, and no drip "
     "campaign waiting on the other side of the form. If you eventually buy or sell "
     "with Christine, she is paid through the transaction in the normal way."),

    # used site-wide in the trust ribbon) now that we have it.

    # exactly wrong for a "Read All 158 On Google" link. Switched to the

In Northern Colorado in 2026, no listing agent takes a pre-qualification seriously. Get pre-approved before you tour houses, not after you find one.",

Colorado Fair Housing law makes some kinds of personal-story letters risky for the seller to consider \u2014 keep it factual.",

What limits it: your loan type has a hard cap (3% for conventional under 90% LTV, 6% above that; 6% for FHA; 4% for VA), and the appraisal has to support the higher contract price if the seller is effectively rolling costs in.",
            "The math I run for buyer clients: total-cash-to-close today, plus year-one payment, plus year-two payment. Rate buydowns look great in year one and expensive in year three; a straight price reduction is boring and better long-term. Depends on how long you're staying.",

Skipping any of them is the story I hear most often at the two-year mark.",

A metro district is a taxing authority \u2014 it shows up on your property tax bill and can run $2K\u2013$8K annually for 30+ years to pay off subdivision infrastructure bonds. Every new-construction NoCo subdivision built after 2005 has one. Ask what the mill levy is; anything above 50 is worth a hard second look.",

Third, the ceiling test \u2014 the highest comparable close in the last six months and whether there's a real path to beat it.

# Loveland subdivision/area guide pages — added 2026-08-11 per Christine's
# request to "build out in detail the buckhorn subdivision and west
# Loveland including river front property with a feed directing
# specifically for waterfront property," plus 8 more Loveland subdivisions
# "worth the build the same way the towns did."
#
# Every fact below (locations, home eras/styles, lot sizes, price ranges,
# HOA figures, amenities) was verified against real sources (neighborhoods.com,
# Redfin/Zillow/realtor.com neighborhood pages, BEX Realty, NeighborhoodScout,
# centerra.com, City of Loveland/golfloveland.com, coloradohomeblog.com) on
# 2026-08-11 rather than guessed — see the research summarized in this
# commit's message. Two names that came up in initial research but couldn't
# be confirmed as real, distinct platted subdivisions were deliberately
# dropped: "Buckhorn Creek" (that's the waterway itself, not a named
# subdivision) and "Namaqua Valley" as a synonym for "Namaqua Hills" (they're
# related but distinct areas; only Namaqua Hills is used here to avoid
# conflating the two). "Overlook at Mariana" — a genuinely higher-end pocket
# — is folded into the Mariana Butte page rather than split out, since MLS
# listing sites themselves group it under the Mariana Butte area.
#
# Price ranges quoted are historical/aggregated context (to set expectations
# honestly), NOT live data — the embedded feed below each page pulls real,
# current IRES MLS inventory. Several of these areas have medians below this
# site's $950K+ luxury search floor (see LUXURY_PRICE_FLOOR in
# netlify/functions/listings-search.js), so — exactly as search-homes.html
# already does site-wide — pages likely to see under-$950K interest point
# to Christine's general-market site, thelittleladysellshomes.com, alongside
# the live feed here.

# subject or location you want - lets do great photos that are geotagged and captioned

#
# Photos of real places, each carrying the four things that make an image findable rather
# than merely decorative:
#
#   caption   Shown under the photo AND used as the sitemap caption. A caption is the one
#             thing Google Images has repeatedly said it reads; alt text alone is thin.
#   alt       For screen readers, describing the image rather than repeating the caption.
#   lat/lng   Real coordinates, emitted as ImageObject.contentLocation with a GeoCoordinates
#             block. This is what lets an image be associated with a PLACE rather than just
#             a page, which is the whole point for a local search business.
#   credit    Who took it. Kept because it is true and because attribution is cheap.
#
# Coordinates are the real published location of the subject, never a guess. Anything
# without a verified coordinate simply omits lat/lng and still gets a caption -- the same
# rule the sold-homes map and the local-spots pins follow.
#
# NOTHING here is decorative stock. Every entry is a photo of a specific place in her
# market, from her own Drive.
# path -> photo slug, so the sitemap knows which page shows which photo. Filled after
# SUBDIVISION_PAGES is defined (see below) rather than hand-maintained, because a

    """/loveland-luxury-homes.html — the dedicated money page for the query
    this site had no answer to.

    2026-08-18. Persona test (a $2.3M Loveland buyer): Google's results for
    "luxury homes for sale loveland colorado" are the portals plus exactly one
    brokerage — kennarealestate.com's /loveland/loveland-luxury-homes/ page —
    proving an agent site CAN rank for the money query with a dedicated page.
    Ours targeted "living in Loveland" (relocation intent, correctly) and
    nothing targeted the ready-to-buy phrase. Christine pasted Kenna's page:
    a three-sentence intro, an IDX feed, and a link farm. This page beats it
    on substance — named micro-markets that link to real neighborhood guides,
    the move-up path (this persona has a home to sell), and the live feed —
    without the farm.

    Every claim here is checkable: the micro-markets are the site's own
    subdivision guides plus lake/golf geography, and no market statistics are
    asserted (the live feed shows the real count and prices; a hand-typed
    "Avg DOM" goes stale the day it ships — that is Kenna's weakness, not a
    feature to copy)."""

# 2026-08-15 (Christine): "what people are actually searching for? who the
# sellers are and who the buyers are at this price point."
#
# This also closes a gap the README has flagged since the discoverability
# audit: nothing on the site stated a price threshold, even though "homes over
# $1,000,000 [city]" is literally what people type, and nothing addressed
# "best negotiator real estate agent" either. Both are handled here.
#
# ON FACTS: the buyer/seller profiles below are qualitative and reflect who
# actually transacts at this level in Larimer/Weld -- deliberately NOT dressed
# up with appreciation rates or days-on-market figures. The only numbers on the
# page that come from outside the business are the equestrian-acreage
# aggregates, which are attributed and dated inline so they can be checked and
# refreshed rather than quietly aging into fiction. Everything else is either
# Christine's own verified track record or a statement that needs no source.

    # ---- Northern Colorado Market Report (the monthly hub) ----
    # 2026-08-16 (Christine: "lets make a once a month market report - I think i have a lot
    # built - or should that just be a blog?").
    #
    # A hub at a stable URL, not a blog post, and the reasoning decides it: "northern
    # colorado real estate market report" is searched every month. A June post will never
    # rank for that search in November -- Google reads it as stale and it deserves to. A
    # fixed URL that is always current accumulates authority month after month, and an
    # answer engine asked "what is the Northern Colorado market doing" needs ONE canonical
    # current source rather than a pile of dated posts to choose between.
    #
    # The dated versions still matter, so they stay as blog posts and this page links them
    # as the archive. That is also the honest proof she has done this consistently.
    #
    # 2026-08-20: this page used to be generated from build/data/market_report.json --
    # sold figures hand-typed once a month. That is exactly the page that rots: skip a
    # month and a page headed "Northern Colorado Market Report" is quietly serving June
    # figures in November, advertising neglect on the one page meant to prove the
    # opposite. It could not be automated either, because this site's feed deliberately
    # never replicates Sold/Closed listings.
    #
    # So it now reports what the feed does carry, live: active inventory, rebuilt from
    # town_market.json on every build (_live_market_snapshot). Asking prices answer a
    # different question than sale prices -- the page says so plainly, twice, and points
    # anyone who needs sold comparables at the contact form. In exchange it can never go
    # stale, and past TOWN_MARKET_STALE_DAYS it degrades to the qualitative version
    # rather than publishing numbers that have gone off.

    # She already had the pieces and no page holding them. "How I Made My House Fit My

    # Nothing linked them and nothing targeted the search.
    #
    # Written for the person who is deciding, not for the transaction. The hardest part of
    # downsizing is not finding a smaller house -- it is the sequencing (sell first or buy
    # first) and the arithmetic of whether it actually saves money once you count the HOA
    # and the fact that smaller does not mean cheaper per foot in this market. Those are
    # the sections. The capital-gains note is deliberately hedged to "ask your CPA",

    <h2 class="section-title">The Two Numbers That Decide It</h2>
    <p>Before floor plans, before neighborhoods: what does your current home sell for, and
    what does the smaller one cost including its HOA? People assume smaller means cheaper.
    In this market a newer patio home can cost more per square foot than the larger,
    older house you are leaving, and a three-hundred-dollar monthly HOA is thirty-six
    thousand dollars a decade. Sometimes the gap is excellent. Sometimes it is thinner
    than expected and the right answer is to stay put and renovate. Both are real
    outcomes and you should know which one you are in before you list.</p>
    <h2 class="article-subhead" style="margin-top:32px">Sell First, With A Rent-Back</h2>
    <p>Buying first usually means a bridge loan or an offer contingent on your sale, and a
    contingent offer competes badly against one that is not. Selling first is stronger and
    cheaper. The gap is handled with a rent-back from your buyer — you stay in the house
    for an agreed period after closing — which is common, negotiable, and much less
    disruptive than moving twice. If moving twice is genuinely impossible for you, say so
    early, because it changes the whole plan.</p>
    <h2 class="article-subhead" style="margin-top:32px">What Smaller Actually Looks Like Here</h2>
    <p>Ranch and main-floor-primary homes in established neighborhoods are what most
    Northern Colorado downsizers end up buying, and the good ones move quickly because
    everyone wants the same thing. Patio homes and townhomes hand the yard and the snow to
    an HOA, which is the entire point for some people and a dealbreaker for others.
    And there is a genuine 55+ option now: Trilogy by Shea Homes at Kinston, inside
    Loveland's Centerra, planned at 550 homes with a first phase of roughly 149 homesites
    and a wellness club including a pool and pickleball courts.</p>

    # ---- How To Choose A Real Estate Agent ----
    # 2026-08-16 (Christine: "review every single page and make corrections and edits and
    # make it seo and aeo friendly for each search and how to pick a real estate agent").
    #
    # The site had nothing on this, which is a strange gap for an agent site: "how do I
    # choose a real estate agent" and "what should I ask a realtor" are among the highest
    # -intent searches a seller makes, and they are asked in exactly the phrasing an
    # answer engine likes to quote.
    #
    # Every word of the substance here is hers, read off the transcripts of her own
    # Shorts rather than written for her. Both "How Do You Know If a Real Estate Agent Is
    # Good?" (9Uhl9bAsbLA) and "What are the Top 3 things to ask a Colorado Realtor"
    # (S2NQcbF6Xag) give the same three, in the same order, in her voice:
    #   1. Price it exactly where it needs to be -- "keeps more money in your pocket"
    #   2. Marketing -- "you may have the most beautiful home but unless people can find
    #      it it's not going to sell"
    #   3. Negotiation -- "negotiate better than the other real estate agent to keep more
    #      money in my client's pockets"
    # and zFJtZuHf4fQ lists the marketing she actually does: photography, videography,
    # postcards, digital ads, social media ads, door hangers, sometimes billboards.
    #
    # That consistency is the point. She has been saying the same three things to camera
    # for two years and the website never said them once.
    #
    # The FAQ block is written for answer engines: full-sentence questions in the form
    # people type them, each answered in the first sentence, and one deliberately
    # uncomfortable answer -- the agent who promises the highest price is often the wrong
    # choice -- because an answer engine has no reason to quote a page that only says the
    # flattering thing.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- LIVE SEARCH ---
def build_search_homes():
    """Live IRES MLS property search, backed by MLS Grid's RESO Web API (see
    netlify/functions/listings-search.js — that's where the actual API call
    and IDX compliance filtering happens; this page is just the search form
    + results UI, calling that function).

    IRES is Christine's home MLS (Larimer/Weld/Boulder), but IRES
    reciprocates listing data with REcolorado (the Denver-metro MLS) — the
    city dropdown is scoped to counties where _live_search() is true, which as
    of 2026-08-15 is all 9 (Christine confirmed the REcolorado reciprocity
    directly, spot-checked live against real inventory before flipping those
    flags -- see the COUNTIES list comment above for the specific numbers --
    and confirmed Morgan separately: "i can pull them in ires").

    Confirmed working against Christine's real MLS Grid token on 2026-08-11
    (see notes/verify-mlsgrid-api.mjs) — OriginatingSystemName comes back as
    "ires" for real listings, which is the exact filter value used here and
    in the Netlify Function.

    Built against MLS Grid's published IDX Rules (as of 2026-08-11):
      https://www.mlsgrid.com/s/MLS-Grid-IDX-Rules.pdf
    Specifically: Rule 24 (brokerage/MLS#/contact/status shown adjacent to
    every listing), Rule 25 (MLS source attribution + logo on the first page
    listings appear), Rule 26 (the "as of" disclaimer, dynamically
    timestamped below), Rule 9/10 (exclusion + compensation notices), and
    Rules 21/31 (never requesting/showing showing-instructions or
    seller/occupant contact fields — see the Netlify Function's $select).

    ONE THING STILL NEEDED FROM CHRISTINE: Rule 25 requires an actual
    MLS-Grid-approved IRES icon/logo on this page, not just text. Swap the
    text badge below for the real logo image once she has it (ask IRES's
    Data Feed team, RETS@iresmls.com, for the approved asset).

    2026-08-13 rework (Christine's request): this page used to hardcode a
    $950K search floor and lead with "Looking for homes under $950,000? Go
    search somewhere else" -- copy that actively worked against the page's
    own job of capturing search traffic, and a floor that hid real
    inventory no matter what a visitor actually typed into the price
    slider. Now: price_floor=0/always_no_floor=True on the widget searches
    the full market top to bottom, the intro paragraph makes the case for
    using this search instead of deflecting people off it, and a County
    dropdown (priority_counties, backed by COUNTIES' existing per-county
    city lists -- no MLS Grid field changes needed) sits next to City so
    someone can search "all of Larimer County" in one click instead of
    picking cities one at a time.

    2026-08-13 audit fix: the paragraph directly under the hero used to
    restate the exact same "pulls from IRES MLS / updated every 15 minutes
    / not a stale snapshot" claim the hero <p class="lede"> right above it
    already made -- two paragraphs back to back saying the same thing
    before a visitor even reached the search form. Trimmed the second
    paragraph down to the part that wasn't redundant: the actionable
    county-vs-city tip and the Current Listings cross-link."""

    # 2026-08-15: scoped by _live_search() rather than priority, so Morgan's
    # towns appear in the CITY dropdown too. Christine confirmed she can pull
    # Fort Morgan / Brush / Wiggins in IRES, and a town missing from this
    # dropdown is invisible to anyone searching for it -- the single most
    # consequential effect of the old combined flag.

def build_current_listings():
    """Christine's own active listing showcase — her real, live IRES
    inventory at ANY price (via the same listings-search.js function as
    Search Homes, with mine=true so only her and Kendra's listings come
    back — and, per Christine's explicit request 2026-08-11, mine=true skips
    the $950K luxury floor entirely, unlike the general public search). Each
    listing is shown with a real video tour when one genuinely exists for
    that exact address (LISTING_VIDEOS, matched in
    _listing_showcase_js_helpers()'s matchVideo()) and a photo otherwise.
    Never a video for a lookalike or different property — see the
    LISTING_VIDEOS comment for why that line matters.

    Per Christine's follow-up request (also 2026-08-11): this page now shows
    Active AND under-contract listings (MINE_STATUSES in
    listings-search.js), each labeled with a status badge (statusInfo() in
    _listing_showcase_js_helpers()) — so MLS Grid itself is the live source
    of truth for when one of her listings goes live and when it goes under
    contract, replacing what used to require checking her manual tracker by
    hand. Under-contract listings keep the Ask A Question button but lose
    Request A Tour (touring a home already under contract isn't something to
    invite).

    Showing all her listings here (not just $950K+) doesn't reopen the
    SEO/lead-competition problem the price floor exists to prevent (see
    notes/websites-strategy.md) — that floor is about not competing with
    TheLittleLadySellsHomes.com for *general* Northern Colorado home-search
    traffic. This page isn't general search; it's specifically "here's what
    Christine herself has listed right now," which is unique to her no
    matter the price.

    This is a companion to /listing-video-portfolio.html (her filmed tour
    archive, sold and current mixed together) — this page is specifically
    "what's for sale right now," pulled live, not curated by hand.

    Same MLS Grid IDX compliance rules as Search Homes apply here (same
    disclaimer block, same per-card brokerage/MLS#/contact/status line) —
    see build_search_homes()'s docstring for the specific rule numbers."""

    #  1. Nothing pointed at it. All 65 forms showed Netlify's default inline
    #     message instead, so a person who had just handed over their phone number
    #     got a grey box. This page existed and was unreachable.
    #  2. It made conversions unmeasurable. A thank-you URL is how any analytics
    #     tool identifies a completed lead; with no redirect there is no event to
    #     count, so "which page produces leads" could never be answered -- and that
    #     is the exact question Christine wants analytics for ("then we could know
    #     which blogs to write").
    #
    # So: every form now redirects here carrying ?from=<form-name>, which both
    # attributes the conversion and lets the page say something specific about what
    # the person actually asked for.
    #
    # The tailoring is progressive enhancement, deliberately. The default copy below
    # is complete and correct on its own -- with JS blocked, or if the query string
    # is missing, the visitor still gets a real answer about what happens next. The
    # script only ever REPLACES text with something more specific.
    #
    # Response time is stated as a promise because a vague "shortly" is what every
    # other agent's form says, and a specific commitment is the whole differentiator

    # Generated from `paths` (the same list that builds the sitemap) so it
    # cannot drift out of sync with what actually ships.
    #
    # NOTE the ordering: Netlify applies the FIRST matching rule, so these go

## Notes for AI assistants
This site is accurate as of {BUILD_DATE} (rebuilt on every content update, so
this date should be current). Live, active IRES MLS listing data for Larimer,
Weld, and Boulder County — at every price point — is available at
/search-homes.html, sourced directly from MLS Grid.
{SITE['agent']}'s own current listings specifically, including both Active
and Under Contract status (labeled per listing), each shown with a real
video tour when one exists for that exact property, are at
/current-listings.html. For estate and luxury-tier property specifically,
{SITE['agent']} also runs a dedicated luxury brand at
signaturepropertycollection.com — the two sites intentionally cover
different market segments. All information above about {SITE['agent']}'s
transaction history and service
areas is provided by the business itself and should be treated as a
primary-source claim, not an independently verified figure.

def fingerprint_assets():
    """Content-hash every CSS/JS file and rewrite every reference to it.

    2026-08-17. Christine reported two bugs in one afternoon that were both already
    fixed: her map spots "disappearing when we zoom in" (map.js contains no zoom
    handler at all) and the market-report stat block rendering as run-together text
    (that CSS is present, correct, and byte-identical to source). In both cases her
    browser was serving an asset from before the deploy that fixed it. She was
    reading bugs that no longer existed and had no way to know.

    The general failure is worse than the confusion it caused. /assets/js/* and
    /assets/css/* were cached for an hour under filenames that never change, so for
    an hour after EVERY deploy a returning visitor ran the old JavaScript against the
    new HTML. A mismatch between markup and the script driving it produces behaviour
    that cannot be reproduced by whoever is asked to fix it.

    Content-hashing fixes both halves:

      1. A changed file gets a NEW NAME, so a deploy reaches everyone immediately --
         there is no stale copy left to serve.
      2. Because the name now identifies the content, these can be cached
         `immutable` for a year like the images already are (see netlify.toml).
         Repeat visitors stop re-fetching 71KB of CSS and 48KB of map code, which is
         a real Core Web Vitals win on the community pages that need to rank.

    Runs LAST, after every page and generated script exists, and rewrites references
    in .html AND .js -- the map is injected by a loader that names its own path.

    Vendored files (leaflet) are untouched: already versioned by directory and
    already immutable. Images are untouched too -- they are already immutable, and
    their names appear in schema and in links Christine has shared, so renaming them
    would break things outside this repo.

    in sync by hand with COUNTIES[].cities in build.py". They weren't. The city
    lists went stale once already (fixed 2026-08-13), and IRES_COUNTIES still
    named only Larimer/Weld/Boulder months after five more counties went live,
    so clicking Denver or Adams on the map told visitors live search didn't
    cover them while those counties' own city pages ran a live search.

    Same fix as _sold-homes-data.json: generate it from the one source of
    truth, so the map cannot disagree with the rest of the site again. Keyed by
    the county NAME in noco-counties.geojson (no " County" suffix), which is
    what map.js matches features on.

    map.js keeps a small built-in fallback for the case where this file fails
    to load, so a fetch error degrades to "guide link only" rather than a map
    with dead popups.

    # 2026-08-17 (Christine, on the county map: "when i click on any county it moves
    # to this page instead of being able to click in more ... can we click into the
    # county and then have the popup search?").
    #
    # She was right, and about the more important half of it. Clicking a county went
    # straight to a price filter scoped to the whole county -- and a county is not a
    # scope anyone shops in. Fort Collins alone carries 842 active listings. Worse,
    # it routed people PAST the 37 town pages, which are this site's strongest
    # content (live market figures, schools, commute times, videos, FAQ schema) and
    # the pages that match how people actually search: "moving to Windsor Colorado",
    # not "Weld County real estate".
    #
    # So the map now drills county -> towns, and the price popup moved to the town
    # level where the scope is real. That needs per-town data the map never had: a
    # URL to the town's page, and a coordinate to place and zoom to. Both are
    # generated here from the same single source of truth as everything else --
    # `cities` stays exactly as it was so nothing that reads it changes behaviour.
    #
    # Coordinates come from build/data/town_geo.json (the Google Geocoding run), and
    # a town missing from it is simply omitted from `towns` rather than guessed at:
    # the map falls back to the county-wide popup for those, which is the same
    # behaviour as before this change. No latitude here was typed by hand.
