# Netlify build step for signaturepropertycollection.com.
#
# 2026-08-15 (Christine: "can you fix it then"). Until now Netlify ran no build
# at all -- it published the committed site/ folder as-is. That was chosen for a
# good reason ("nothing that can fail at deploy time"), but it has a nasty edge:
# editing build/build.py and pushing changed NOTHING on the live site, with no
# error anywhere to explain why. You had to remember to run the build locally and
# commit the regenerated site/ too. This script removes that trap.
#
# It deliberately distinguishes two kinds of failure, because they deserve
# opposite treatment:
#
#   1. The BUILD ENVIRONMENT can't run the generator at all -- no python3, no
#      pip, missing wheels. That is not a problem with the site's content, and
#      failing the deploy over it would block every future deploy including ones
#      that only touch netlify/functions or already-committed HTML. So: log it
#      loudly, publish the committed site/ (exactly today's behaviour), exit 0.
#
#   2. python3 RAN and build/build.py or the post-build audit gate errored. That
#      is a real defect in the content/output, and publishing a half-written or
#      knowingly-regressed site/ would be worse than not deploying. So: restore
#      committed site/, fail the deploy, and keep the last good production build.
#
# Net effect: never worse than the old no-build-step setup, and correct when the
# environment is healthy.
#
# PYTHON_BIN, BUILD_SCRIPT and POSTPROCESS_SCRIPT are overridable so failure paths
# can be exercised in tests rather than discovered in production.
