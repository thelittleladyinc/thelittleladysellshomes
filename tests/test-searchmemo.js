// 2026-08-18 (Christine: "it just runs so slow ... what if we just brought in a
// few counties"). She was right that the size was the problem and wrong about the
// mechanism, which made the real cause easy to miss: every public search read
// LISTINGS_KEY — 29,011 listings — out of Blobs and JSON-parsed all of it, per
// request, to answer a query about twelve. The cost scaled with the catalogue and
// had nothing to do with what was asked, which is why it degraded as the crawl
// grew and felt like "bringing in too many".
//
// What this suite protects is the three ways a memo like this goes wrong: it never
// hits, it hits when the data has changed underneath it, or it hits forever.
