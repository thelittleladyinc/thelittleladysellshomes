// Internal link structure — the thing that decided whether pages got indexed.
//
// 2026-08-16 (Christine: "can you review the ones the did index conmpared to the ones
// they didnt and then make the rest much better?").
//
// Measured against her Search Console coverage export: 39 pages indexed, 62 "Crawled
// - currently not indexed". Auditing all 144 built pages found the cause was
// structural, not editorial:
//
//   * 31 town pages had exactly ONE inbound internal link each -- their county page.
//     They were not thin: 650-940 unique non-template words, above the site median.
//     Google had read them and declined, which is what it does with pages the site
//     itself treats as unimportant.
//   * /communities/index.html -- the hub, itself linked from all 144 pages -- linked
//     the 20 COUNTY pages and not one town page. Its authority stopped one level short
//     of the pages targeting "homes for sale in <town>".
//   * The 10 Loveland subdivision pages had the same problem, 1 inbound link each.
//
// After the fix every one of those pages has 6+ inbound links and the only page with
// none is 404.html, which correctly has none.
//
// This suite exists because that regression would be invisible. Nothing would look
// broken, no page would 404, and the cost would appear months later as pages quietly
// dropping out of the index.
//
// Repo root derived from this file's own location, never hardcoded: these suites
// run both locally and in GitHub Actions, where the checkout is at
// /home/runner/work/<repo>/<repo>. An absolute path would pass here and fail there.
