// Ported 2026-09-30 from the Signature repo with the function(s) it covers
// (Signature move, part 1, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md). It exercises the copied code
// through each function's localHandler; whether that code or the pass-through to
// Signature answers a visitor is lib/_backend-mode.js's decision, pinned in

//
// The health page must be live, or it is worse than not existing.
//
// 2026-08-17. Christine: "confirm that all is valid and live for the health status
// or else there is no reason for it." She said that after "I feel like I already
// did the cloud thing yesterday" -- and she had. The page was still showing the
// pre-fix Cloudinary verdict, I read it, and I told her it was still broken.
//
// The cause was structural, not cosmetic. Five rows on that page are live probes
// whose results are cached in Blobs: Google, the photo chain, Cloudinary, the
// Lofty key, the Lofty lead. All five were gated behind ?probe=1, so a plain
// /status visit rendered whatever the last probe concluded -- with no cap on its
// age, and for three of the five, no date printed at all. A verdict from days ago
// was indistinguishable from one from this second.
//
// MY FIRST FIX WAS THE WRONG ONE, and that is worth recording. I made the probes
// refresh themselves. It broke three suites, each guarding a lesson this codebase
// had already paid for: a plain page load makes no outbound calls
// (test-leadprobe.js); rows must not go red for things that are not actually
// broken -- "the crying-wolf mistake the Cloudinary row already taught us"
// (test-optional.js); a considered cached verdict must not be silently overwritten
// (test-tagsnotreturned.js). Probing was never the missing piece. DISCLOSURE was.
//
// So this suite pins the properties that make the page mean something without
// spending a cent of quota:
//
//   1. A plain load still makes NO outbound calls. That promise stands.
//   2. A stale reading SAYS it is stale, in absolute time and in words, and stops
//      counting as a pass or a fail -- because it is neither.
//   3. A summary row at the top names everything that is not live, and how to
//      make it live. One click, not five rows of date arithmetic.
//   4. A FRESH failure still fails. Staleness must never become an excuse.
// 2026-09-28: this suite pins the MLS Grid path, which stays in the code as the
// switch-back (LISTINGS_SOURCE=mlsgrid). The Lofty path is test-lofty-source.js.
