// The thank-you page, and the form-name contract that three separate files depend on.
//
// 2026-08-16 (Christine, on making the site stronger: analytics so she can "know
// which blogs to write"). A thank-you URL is how any analytics tool identifies a
// completed lead. Before this, site/thank-you.html existed and NOTHING pointed at
// it -- all 65 forms showed Netlify's default inline message -- so there was no
// conversion event to count and "which page produces leads" was unanswerable.
//
// The same cross-check that added the redirect also found three forms
// (luxury-market, concierge-page-inquiry, testimonials-page-inquiry) with no Lofty
// source label, arriving in her CRM tagged with a raw slug. That is drift between
// build.py, submission-created.js and the thank-you copy, and drift is what tests
// are for -- so all three are pinned here rather than fixed once and left to rot.
//
// Repo root derived from this file's own location, never hardcoded: these suites
// run both locally and in GitHub Actions, where the checkout is at
// /home/runner/work/<repo>/<repo>. An absolute path would pass here and fail there.
