// Ported 2026-09-30 from the Signature repo with the function(s) it covers
// (Signature move, part 1, docs/SIGNATURE-MOVE.md). It checks the copied code;
// whether that code or the pass-through to Signature answers a visitor is
// lib/_backend-mode.js's decision, pinned in tests/test-sharedproxy.js.
//
// Every file a function READS AT RUNTIME must be declared in included_files.
//
// 2026-08-17. /listing/<id> — the feature Christine asked for by name, so a buyer
// could text one address to a spouse — answered every request with Netlify's red
// "This function has crashed" page and a stack trace:
//
//   ENOENT: no such file or directory, open
//   '/var/task/netlify/functions/lib/_listing-page-shell.html'
//
// The file is committed, is not gitignored, is produced by the build, and the path
// in the code is correct. NONE of that puts it inside the deployed function.
// Netlify's bundler ships what it can TRACE, and it traces require(). Every other
// file in lib/ is .js or .json and is require()d, which is why they have always
// worked; the shell is the one file read with fs.readFileSync, which the bundler
// cannot see.
//
// This is the exact shape of defect that survives a thorough static audit: I had
// just checked that every function loads, every endpoint resolves, every internal
// link works and every asset reference exists — and all of that was true while the
// endpoint was down, because the file was present locally and absent in the bundle.
//
// So the rule is pinned at the only place it can be: any runtime read must have a
// matching included_files entry.
