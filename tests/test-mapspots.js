// Christine's spots must never be hidden by a map view.
//
// 2026-08-17. Building the county drill-down, I hid every base marker on entering
// a county so town pins would not render on top of the city icons for the same
// town. That was right for city icons and wrong for everything else: it also hid
// the POI markers, which are her spots — the "▶ Watch" pins carrying her YouTube
// tours and reviews with their real view counts. She opened a county and wrote
// "all of my embedded videos are all gone!!!! I had so many".
//
// Nothing had been deleted, and that is beside the point. Those pins are the one
// thing this map has that a portal map structurally cannot, and a view that hides
// them is broken whether or not the data survives. Reassurance is not a fix and a
// comment is not a mechanism, so the rule gets pinned here.
//
// WHY A STRING CHECK. tests.yml stays dependency-light and a browser in CI is a
// second thing to keep working — the same reasoning test-mobilegrid.js records for
// the same reason. A browser found this one (9 town pins, 0 city markers, POI
// still present); this pins the cause, which is a property of the source.
